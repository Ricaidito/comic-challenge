# Comic Vine API website challenge

This web application was created in order to complete the challenge of creating an application that consumes the [Comic Vine API](https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/documentation) and displays its information.

To run the application it is necessary to use the proxy server to avoid CORS issues as well as the proper `.env` files containing the `API_KEY` (on the server) and the `VITE_API_URL` (on the website).
